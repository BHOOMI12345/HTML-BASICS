    When you're learning, small examples can be very helpful.

The Python Standard Library, an electronically published book by Fredrik Lundh, examines most of the modules in Python's standard library, describing what the module does and giving a short example of its use. Note that this book is now relatively old and so misses a lot of the developments of the last two decades.

The Python Cookbook, from ActiveState, is a very large collection of code snippets, some elementary and some advanced.
